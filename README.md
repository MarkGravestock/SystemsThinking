SystemsThinking
===============

Simple model of Systems Theory concepts.

It includes a model of a Bath, a system with a single Stock (the water in the bath) with a single Flow in (water from a tap) and a single Flow out (from the plug).

This example is taken from [Donnela Meadow's 'Thinking in Systems'](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B005VSRFEA?btkr=1) and implements the example of dynamic equilibrium.
